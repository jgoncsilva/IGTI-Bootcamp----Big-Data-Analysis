Approximately 500 scholarships for bootcamps were made available (in April 2020) to students who passed a basic programming logic test. I was one of them!

The choice of this Bootcamp for data analysis aimed to learn important tools especially when it comes to Big Data.

The course modules are respectively:

[Fundamentals](https://github.com/jgoncsilva/IGTI-Bootcamp---Data-Analysis/tree/master/Fundamentals%20-%20Module%201) 

[Data processing using Hadoop ecosystem](https://github.com/jgoncsilva/IGTI-Bootcamp---Data-Analysis/tree/master/Hadoop%20%20-%20Module%202)

[Processing Techiques for Big Data - **PySpark**](https://github.com/jgoncsilva/IGTI-Bootcamp----Big-Data-Analysis/tree/master/Processing%20Techiques%20for%20Big%20Data)

It was a great experience to get to know the processing of large amounts of data, as well as tools such as KNIME for ETL, and NoSQL databases.
